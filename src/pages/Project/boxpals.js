                  Boxpals was created as the final project for BrainStation’s
                  part-time web development program. The primary goal of the
                  project is to showcase learnings from the program in a
                  self-directed project that was to be completed in addition to
                  regular course work.

                  As this project was course work, the product remains
                  hypothetical. However, the project exceeded expectations by
                  receiving a grade of 98% and was well received by both the
                  teaching team and the public at BrainStation’s quarterly demo

                I uncovered how the shipping and over-packing of goods are some

                on shipping costs. This directly decreases the environmental
                impact of these purchases by reducing amount of shipping
                materials necessary to fufill them.

                  Yes, it would. However through trial and error, I learned how
                  technically difficult and costly implementing it would be due
                  to the fact that it would require a lot of API calls to a
                  large number of organizations (some of which do not have a
                  public facing API). This resulted in the manual solution seen
                  above.

                  As a designer by trade, I’m proud of that I was able to build
                  this proof of concept within the time constraints, using both
                  my design background and my knew learnings in full stack
                  development. There are so many things that I would go back and
                  add to this project if I had the time. Some of the main ideas
                  include, a group order manager view or dashboard and a more
                  technically advanced method of inputting items in order to
                  reduce cognitive overhead and increase usability. There are
                  also a number of smaller additions that I believe would
                  benefit people, such as account statuses to know what stage
                  people are at in the group order process, a better integrated
                  notifications, and an integrated method to complete payments
                  whether through something like Stripe or other means.

                  Cultivate Inclusivity was made as a part of the Civic
                  Innovation Change Lab (CICL) program, an initiative created by
                  Radius SFU, CityStudio, and the City of Vancouver. CICL is a
                  9-credit program where interdisciplinary students form teams
                  to develop a project under the umbrella of civic innovation.

                <p className="content__body">
                  The project was well received in terms of both class
                  assessment and with the general public. Aside from an academic
                  setting, the project was submitted to SFU’s Opportunity Fest
                  2020, and CityStudio’s Hubub 14: The Digital Edition.
                  Cultivate Inclusivity was able to win 1st Place and
                  Entrepreneur’s Choice awards at Opportunity Fest.

                  However, it is difficult to track the social and financial
                  investments being made in the community due to the lack of
                  coordination and collaboration. As investigating and
                  understanding the countless amount of services offered was
                  impossible to do in the available time period, we narrowed
                  this down to taking a deeper look into employment services in
                  the DTES.

                  personal and societal effects that lead to an individual
                  developing barriers to employment is a massive undertaking.
                  That is why, this project was informed by secondary research
                  and informal interviews with a number of organizations in
                  Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (DTES). Throughout the 4 month
                  term, we visited and interviewed 15 organizations, seen below.

                Professionally, this project gave me a lot of different
                constraints when compared to a typical academic project. One of
                the biggest ones was the idea of a limited or non-existent
                access to technology. How does one create a system for multiple
                people without access to a device? Without access to an address?
                Internet? How does one account for a large variety of different
                use cases? This project also got me to challenge my preconceived
                notion of how people might engage with technology.
